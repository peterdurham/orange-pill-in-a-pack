That finite supply is set at 21 million bitcoin. Bitcoin's limited supply is a huge advantage, because it keeps the cryptocurrency scarce, helping to maintain or increase its value for years to come. Bitcoin is quickly becoming a global currency and store of value, and with a population of 8 billion, owning even a small portion of one bitcoin puts you ahead of the curve and places you in a great advantage pointby holding a portion of the worlds first finite asset.",
